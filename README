Experimental bridge between RabbitMQ and Redis implemented as a RabbitMQ plugin.

Introduction
------------

This plugin moves messages between RabbitMQ and Redis Pub/Sub (http://redis.io/topics/pubsub).
It was inspired by RabbitMQ-shovel and shares the same idea with the exception 
that it connects Redis pub/sub channels to RabbitMQ queues or exchanges.

For building see instructions at:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html

Configuration
-------------

The plugin is configured using rabbitmq.config file that has a structure 
like this:

[{rabbit, [rabbit-settings]},
 {rabbit_redis, [rabbitmq-redis-plugin-settings]}
].

Example of rabbitmq.config with rabbitmq-redis plugin:
